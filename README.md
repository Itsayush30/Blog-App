# Blog App Backend

This project is a simple blog application backend built using Node.js, Express, and a database (SQL or NoSQL). The backend provides a RESTful API for managing blog posts, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts. The application also includes authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure the API endpoints.

## Features

- **GET /posts**: List all blog posts.
- **GET /posts/:id**: Retrieve a specific blog post by ID.
- **POST /posts**: Create a new blog post.
- **PUT /posts/:id**: Update an existing blog post by ID.
- **DELETE /posts/:id**: Delete a blog post by ID.
- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints using JWT.
- Basic error handling and input validation.
